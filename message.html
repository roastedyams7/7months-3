        Happy 7 months, my baby.  
 Thanks for always being so understanding and caring toward me. I really love how much you care and how thoughtful you are. I truly love spending time with you, and I appreciate all the effort you put into our relationship, honey 💖. I'm sorry for not being perfect, so that's why one of the things I love most about you is that you're willing to understand me, whether that be not doing things that make me uncomfortable or compromising with me. I really hope I can become a better person for you so that you love every second you spend with me as much as I do with you. I still remeber one of the sweetest things you've said to me was about when you knew you loved me because of how patient and respectful I was but I knew I loved you when being with you felt right and being apart from you felt like something about me was missing so that's why I always want to support you and help you with your overthinking or anything.       </p>
